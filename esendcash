Online lenders can be a convenient and fast option for personal loans. Many online lenders let you pre-qualify to estimate your rate without affecting your credit score. They often let you apply, receive the money and make payments completely online.

Online loans typically have annual percentage rates from 6% to 36%, and loan amounts range from $1,000 to $100,000. Researching lenders to find one that matches your needs and credit score can expedite the application process. Lenders like Discover and LightStream can be options for those with good or excellent credit (credit score of 690 or higher), while Upstart and Upgrade accept borrowers with fair or bad credit (credit score of 689 or lower).
