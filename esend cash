Having a bank account is often a requirement to get a personal loan through one of the payday lending networks weâ€™ve recommended.

CashUSA.com, for example, requires prospective borrowers to have a checking account in their name. The account is initially used to deposit cash from your loan provider.

Other requirements include:

    Be at least 18 years old.
    Be a US citizen or permanent resident.
    Earn a steady monthly income of at least $1,000 after taxes.
    Provide work and home phone numbers, and a valid email address.
