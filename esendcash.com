Gather documentation: Know what you need to apply for the loan so the lender can easily verify your identity, income and other information. Lenders often say their ability to fund a loan quickly depends on borrowers’ responsiveness to requests for documentation.

Calculate estimated payments: Use a personal loan calculator to see how credit score and the length of the loan term can affect monthly payments. Then consider how the estimated monthly payment may impact your budget.

Pre-qualify and compare loans: Pre-qualifying for a personal loan helps lenders understand your creditworthiness and shows you how much you may qualify for. It doesn’t guarantee you a loan, but it can help you compare loans without affecting your credit score. It’s a good idea to research lenders to identify loans with the lowest rate. This may mean looking at your bank, local credit union and online lenders for comparison.

 Apply: You can apply for a personal loan in person or online, depending on your lender. Smaller banks and credit unions may request in-person applications, while online lenders offer web-based applications. You can typically get a decision within a day after submitting all the necessary information. If you're approved, expect to receive the funds in your bank account within a day or two.
